            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                I am currently working towards a B.S. in Computer Science at California State University, Northridge, expecting to graduate in the Summer of 2020.
                I am also employed at my university's central IT as a part-time Web Developer.
                Alongside a team of highly talented, bright, and creative individuals, I help design, build, test, and maintain online platforms
                that are utilized campus-wide.
            </p>
            <p>
                Iâ€™m passionate about the art of development and turning ideas into reality. I have always enjoyed building things since a young age from
                building model aircraft carriers with my dad to spending hours on end playing Minecraft creative mode.
                A little later on in life, I discovered the wonderful world of writing code and the endless amount of possibilities that exists within it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although I commit a significant portion of my time juggling between school, work, and trying to understand other people's code,
                I allocate some of my spare time outside of work to indulge in activities I enjoy which includes playing the guitar, video games,
                sports, photography, and reading random things on the internet.
            </p>
